# pi.spwn

A simple program I made to dynamically calculate pi on Geometry Dash using the SPWN language developed by Spu7nix.

## Usage

To generate the level please download the SPWN builder from https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language.

After that you can run this code

```bat
spwn.exe
spwn build pi.spwn
```
